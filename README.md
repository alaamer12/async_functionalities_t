# About
this project should provide async feature for users[developers]

i just wanted to know how to make functionality like in FastAPI where u can use both sync and async code

this is the purpose of this project to do similar thing, but unfortunately Chatgpt can't help this time, it does not give the expected result

so we shall change our way of doing things and maybe with some researches we can do it with async
